# The-Secrets

The Node.js based web application that provides users with a secure platform to store and manage their secrets. The project uses authentication to ensure that only authenticated users can access and modify their secrets.

To achieve this, the project uses Node.js with Express.js framework and the express-session middleware to track user sessions. This allows the application to keep track of users who have authenticated and ensure that they remain authenticated throughout their session.

In addition, the project uses Passport.js, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js, to handle the authentication process. Passport.js provides a range of authentication strategies such as local, social, and multi-factor authentication to ensure that users can authenticate using a method that best suits them.

By using Passport.js, the project also ensures that user data is kept safe and secure. Passport.js provides a range of security features such as password hashing, encryption, and two-factor authentication to ensure that user data is not compromised.

Overall, the Node.js project provides a secure and reliable platform for users to store and manage their secrets, with features such as user authentication and session tracking implemented using Express.js and express-session middleware, and data safety features such as encryption and password hashing implemented using Passport.js.
